{"name":"The real ship","writer":"Ambry of the Sofaye Cult","tags":["8"],"theory":"Sofaye is real. Faye is a part of Colin, and Colin x Sofia is canon. \n\nIf you don’t like this explanation, I can also tell you our dear Colin feels so lonely he imagines Faye, but also Sofia and Asher. But he knows he isn’t good enough for Sofia and Faye... He *knows* it. So he just let Sofia and Faye live a happy life, while he asks to Sigmund to make Sofia x Colin canon and then erase themselves. That created Asher."}
