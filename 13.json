{"name":"My take on TML","writer":"nighthnh099","tags":["1","9"],"theory":"so this theory is just a rundown of the game and how I think it connects to the other games\n\nso in the intro before the title screen we see the objects render, which is obviously the machine beginning to render the simulation, or just a cool effect 2008 kan added, could be both idk\n\nso some gameplay happens which I won't touch on since it's just the gameplay up till this point\nmy theory on the plant thing is, it's just something either faye or neil put there to lead to the ending of the simulation (will touch on that later)\n\nthe caller who calls leah and the person who emails her are the same person, *except* when it's 3:26, the abrupt (more than usual) nature of the call combined with the bluntness (\"It's 3:26.\") leads me to believe this is either faye or neil who is the one talking, why? to push leah to the basement and make the plot happen and (probably) test the machine. Then Leah goes to the basement and pulls the third lever, which triggers the fire. The switch probably triggered the fire, and I mean by pulling the switch, the machine starts the fire. Then Leah heads to the bed and sleeps for 5 hours, the bed falls at some point as well which I don't have an explanation for. The fire seems to have left no trace of itself, so probably just a visual summoned by the machine.\n\nSo second half of the game: The fire triggers the table in that room in the basement to move, neil machine magic I'm guessing, the emails seem to want leah to *not* get to birdie, which if this game is canon, would most possibly be faye. There's not enough info in tml or even in the other games to know who would want to but that would explain why the table was blocked in the basement before 3:26. It was so leah could not respond to the other person emailing her, and after 3:26, leah conveniently sleeps for several hours, missing all of the other emails, almost as if she was meant to read it once the emailer gave up to \"Kill the birdie\". Judging by the ending, the emailer/caller was unsuccessful, as faye/birdie arrived to pick leah up. Like in the end of impostor factory, once leah is picked up, faye probably destroys or despawns the world, as we see leah dissappear but the bird remain. \n\nNow the last thing, in the last few moments of the game, leah pulls out her gun, which has one bullet leftover from when she gunned the door in the basement down, this implies she planned to maybe kill birdie/faye as the emailer wished to do, but since she disappears in the next scene, this would mean what I said previously, the simulation was shut down before she could shoot birdie/faye\n\nI can't theorize on all of the ending text because I've only seen two snippets of them: the one on my playthrough and the one on ZedManul's playthrough. The one on mine simply states \"The others should be safe, now...\" don't worry on the comma, that's something people put because of the differences between written and spoken english (ha english lessons finally came in handy). Now, \"the others should be safe now\", maybe leah is a threat? or some sort of thing that needs to be contained? or maybe tml was a test scenario to destroy something that could kill the \"others\"? Now on ZedManul's is a bit more, eh, unsubtle. (\"Well...I suppose that worked.\") This one practically confirms a test of some kind, it also neither proves or disproves the dialogue on my playthrough interestingly.\n\nalso one last thing, leah having no face probably hints more at the simulation theory ig, the sigmund corp universe, which this takes place in supposedly, is realistic enough, so to have someone with no face be in this universe would imply some sort of simulation"}
