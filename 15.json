{"name":"The Korbin Conspiracy","writer":"DevAnj","tags":["0"],"theory":"So I was thinking about this when eating dinner. While it makes little sense for Aeria to spy on Korbin Village, it *does* make some more sense if they were infact spying on Lunair and the effects of the Quintessence on her, since she was sent to take Serai's place. Of course, this runs into the issue of Lunair scoring an F in spying, and her as a Quintessence candidate being rather inexplicable still. Sure, the Quintessence is supposed to be top secret, but I'm sure the imperial government could easily hire some secret agents from among their military and willingly make them test subjects instead of jeopardizing the Duke's own offspring.\n"}
