{"name":"The nature of the house","writer":"dwedwdwede","tags":["1"],"theory":"The Mirror Lied has, ironically, no actual mirrors. Even the bathrooms seem to lack them. We should then conclude that there's no literal mirror in the game, but rather, a figurative one. And what could that be? Well, likely the house itself.\n\nYou see, when \"Birdie\" breaks the ceiling of the house to let Leah escape, we clearly hear the sound of glass breaking. This is despite the fact that the house's roof seems to be made of cement, or something hard like that. Not just that - time seems to be warped while within the house. The title screen's clock's hour hand goes from 1 to 7 o'clock, yet the minute hand makes 11 rotations for it to get there. Further, in the game itself, the clock chimes the right amount of bells for nearly every time, *except* 3. This is of course because the bird \"meets\" her at 3:26 and causes a fire. Also, the water everywhere turns red and the clock doesn't chime for any time past 8.\n\nSo, the house is itself a home of illusions, and thus technically a \"mirror\" of the real world. And it clearly lies to Leah, which is why the game is titled \"The Mirror Lied\"."}
