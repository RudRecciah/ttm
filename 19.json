{"name":"The colors of the memory orbs","writer":"DevAnj","tags":["4","8","9"],"theory":"I noticed that the collection of orbs represent the four Greek elements, as well as Darkness from the Light/Darkness pairing. While this is to be expected, considering they were reused from Quintessence, I was quite surprised to find that Light wasn't represented. I looked around a bit for why this is the case, and ran into one example sharing this distribution of elements - the Japanese elemental system. So, potentially, this could be a reference to that.\n\nHowever, after enough searching, I concluded that it's far more likely that Kan picked these colors because they double up as mood or personality indicators very well, given his response during the QnA video. For instance, blue, the color of water, could indicate a calm person, or a thoughtful one. Green, the color of wind, could depict an adventurous person, but also a greedy one. Red, a short tempered person, or a passionate one. So on and so forth. \n\nSo why isn't Light represented? Well, Light is a visual shorthand for positive experiences, usually happy ones, and in Sigmund Corporation stories, happiness is often fleeting and sometimes outright false - after all, they tend to be depressing and gloomy stories which are \"fixed\" through the doctors' meddling with them. \n\nFor this similar reason, Darkness gets represented in the memory orbs - it's a very quick and convenient shorthand for tragedy or gloom. While you *could* possibly represent feelings of sadness or gloom through the Greek elements, for the stories in question having the shorthand around is more direct and effective."}
