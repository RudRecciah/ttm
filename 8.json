{"name":"Rud Conspiracy","writer":"Kobalt","tags":["4","5","6","7","8","9"],"theory":"Rud's mass theorizing is part of a conspiracy with Kan to throw off fans' expectations. Kan is known to have used misdirection and vagueness when discussing his works in the past. Having and insider in the community to spread as many theories as possible would add further confusion while increasing anticipation for the game's actual conclusion. Kan has publicly rebuked Rud's theorizing ways in the Free Bird discord server, but this may only serve to make Rud more credible as a legitimate theorizing body. "}
