{"name":"Minisode 2 Theory","writer":"Fuzion the Doomba","tags":["4","6","8","9"],"theory":"Heres my minisode 2 theory\nSo we all know that Eva is in the machine and she sees herself in the street. SO, this could be Faye since she turns into Eva twice in the series, and this entire thing could be way in the future when Neil stores memories publicly and Eva wants to remember her sister who may not be alive in the future and she's reliving her times with her sister, all the Neil stuff could be explained by a top stack Neil AI being shocked by a bottom stack Neil who changed a few variables to see what happens, resulting in minisode Neil being shocked and meeting Eva and the ghostly Neil changing behind the scenes."}
